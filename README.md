Brief data analysis of pittsburgh real estate using jupyter notebooks and open data
## Data
The data comes from different sources. I would have put the data files up here, but they're too large for Github's limits. If you need the files, email me, I'll be happy to send them to you as well as tell you where I got them. 
## The Goal
To better understand the Pittsburgh real estate market. What I'm really doing is seeing if there's a reason for the rise in prices lately -- such as population growth or a bump in income.
## Spoilers
The real estate market prices in PGH are outpacing population and income growth. However, the prices may have been partially affected by recover from The Great Recession as prices look to be leveling off. I'll be doing more of these in the coming months and more next year. Stay tuned.
